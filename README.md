# Tours-Plan

## Description
Tours-Plan is a responsive React application that displays a list of tour cards, each with a place name, image, price, and description. Users can mark tours as "not interested," which removes them from the list. When all tours are removed, a "No Tours Left" message is shown with an option to refresh the list. The app is designed to be fully responsive.
